<h2>Battlebots</h2>
<p>This is bot 1. Add it's description in assets/decription/1.html.</p> 
<p>The '1' in the bot_id link parameter  maybe changed to any id decided by the team. The url calls will have to be made with trailing ?bot_id=(id).</p>
<p>Also the html files' and images'  name can be changed accordingly :)</p>
<p>From now on we can just add an h2 heading and a few p tags  in this folder, add link in index page and a new link will be opened. Work simplified,code shortened, storage space saved......... </p>
